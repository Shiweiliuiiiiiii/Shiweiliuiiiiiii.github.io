Hi, I am a [Royal Society Newton International Fellow](https://royalsociety.org/grants/newton-international/) at University of Oxford, a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at [Somerville College](https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the VITA group funded by IFML at UT Austin, working with Atlas Wang. I obtained my Ph.D. at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), the Netherlands, under the supervision of Mykola Pechenizkiy and Decebal Constantin Mocanu.

**Research Interests**
======
My general research interests are to understand and leverage the role of low dimensionality in machine learning, whose impacts span many important topics, including but not limited to efficient training/inference of large foundation models, algorithm and system co-design, and ML interpretability.

**Potential Collaborations:** If you are interested in these topics, feel free to reach out for more information!
